# web-scraping-notes-v1
These are  my notes for learning the basics of web scraping in Python, with BeautifulSoup and Selenium. I will create more repository's around web scraping for projects, but these are the infrastructure of what I'm learning. 
I also have my first (small) web scraping project, where I made a table, using pandas and DataFrame, to illustrate the product name, price, description, and reviews.
